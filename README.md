## Quickstart

Include this `<script>` tag in the `<head>` of your page:

`<script type="text/javascript" src='https://unpkg.com/dom-particles'></script>`

Then somewhere in the `<body>` include the following script:

```
<script type='text/javascript'>
  const t = new DomParticles();
  const c = { x: document.body.clientWidth / 2 , y: document.body.clientHeight / 2 };

  t.addEmitter({
    position: { x: c.x, y: c.y },
    particleOptions: {
      velocity: { y: -50 },
      contents: 'Hello world'
    }
  });
</script>
```

## Alternative installation via NPM

`npm install --save dom-particles`

then in your code:

```
import DomParticles from 'dom-particles'

const d = new DomParticles();
...

```

## Development

`git clone` this repository, then:

```
cd dom-particles
npm i

# Uses parcel to start a hot-reloading playground on port 1234
npm run dev

# Builds dom-particles.js to lib/
npm run build

# Runs unit tests with Mocha
npm run test

```

# API Reference

## DomParticles object

The DomParticles object is the chief way of creating particles and emitters.

By default, a DomParticles only uses the `requestAnimationFrame` API to update itself
while a particle or emitter is extant. After the last particle or emitter reaches the end of its
lifespan, the DomParticles will unregister itself and stop updating until the next `add` or `addEmitter` call.

### Options

| Name          | Default             | Remarks                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max`         | `100`               | Maximum number of particles on screen at any one time. Global across all emitters                                           |
| `preallocate` | `10`                | How many particle elements to create by default and add to the DOM. More will be created on-demand, up to the `max` amount. |
| `tagName`     | `span`              | Tag to use for particle elements                                                                                            |
| `container`   | document `body` tag | Parent container for all particles. Will have `position:relative` applied to the styles.                                    |
| `autostart`   | `true`              | If `false`, particles will not be animated until `.start()` is called on the parent `DomParticles` instance                 |

### Methods

- `.addParticle(options)` - Create a particle from the provided `options` object (see below for particle options)
- `.addEmitter(options)` - Create a particle emitter from the provided `options` object (see below for emitter options)
- `.start()` - If `autostart: false` was passed to this instance, call this function manually to begin animation.
- `.reset()` - Removes all particles and emitters.
- `.clearEmitters()` - Removes all emitters. Existing particles will remain until the end of their lifespan.

## Particles

Particles are created (and returned) by the `add` function on a `DomParticles` object.
By default they have a finite lifespan, after which they disappear from the DOM.

At each frame, the following default update is applied to a particle:

```
velocity += acceleration;
position += velocity;
```

There are also three update hooks which can be provided in the particle options: `onCreate`, `onUpdate`, and `onDestroy`. All of these are called with the particle object as the first argument. For `onUpdate`, the second argument is the elapsed time (in fractions of a second, so `1.0` is one second) since the last `onUpdate` call.

Velocity and acceleration are specified in units of pixels per second. For example, a particle with a `ttl` of `1000` milliseconds and a velocity of `{ x: 10 }` will travel ten pixels to the right during its lifespan.

| `style`        | `{}`            | object of styles to be applied to the particle. Style values can be arrays, for animation purposes - see section **Styling Particles** below.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `heading`      | `false`         | Set to a number in range `0`...`2 * Math.PI` to manually control the particle heading in an `onUpdate` handler, otherwise animate using the `rotation` style.                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `position`     | `{x : 0, y: 0}` | Particle position. If particle is created by an emitter, this is taken to be relative to the emitter's position; if not, it's taken to be relative to the container element of the parent `DomParticles` object.

### Methods

- `setText(text)`: Sets the `innerText` of the particle element to `text`
- `setContents(html)`: Sets the `innerHTML` of the particle element to `html`
- `updateStyle(styleObject)`: Update particle element styles

### Styling particles

The `style` property of a particle options object, or a `particleOptions` object passed to an `Emitter`, is not limited to static properties or getters. You can pass an array of values for a specific property, like so:

```
t.add({
  style: {
    'backgroundColor': ['#fff', '#000']
  }
});
```

Over the lifetime (`ttl` property) of the particle, the values in this array will be linearly interpolated between
for the purpose of the particle's actual style at a particular moment in time. In the above example, a particle with a `ttl` of `500` milliseconds will begin life at `t = 0` with a white background but end it at `t = 500` with a black one.

The array of values can be any length. Most simple CSS properties (colours; unit + value eg `1px`, `2em` etc) are supported. Compound properties have to be manipulated component-by-component.

There are also some CSS transform properties which are included as separate arguments for ease-of-use. These are as follows:

- `scale` (or just `scaleX` or `scaleY`) - scale the element. This is the _transform_ version of scale, not the general CSS property.
- `rotation` - rotate the element, but takes lower precedence than the `heading` property.
- `skew` (or just `skewX` or `skewY`) - skew the element

## Emitters

Emitters are created (and returned) by the `addEmitter` function on a `DomParticles` object. They provide a convenient way to create multiple particles with similar properties.
